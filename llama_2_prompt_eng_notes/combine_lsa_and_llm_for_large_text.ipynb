The U.S. is the world's third-largest country by both land and total area.[c] It shares land borders with Canada to its north and with Mexico to its south and has maritime borders with the Bahamas, Cuba, Russia, and other nations.[j] With a population of over 333 million,[k] it is the most populous country in the Americas and the third-most populous in the world.

       "Indigenous peoples have inhabited the Americas for thousands of years. Beginning in 1607, British colonization led to the establishment of the Thirteen Colonies in what is now the Eastern United States. They clashed with the British Crown over taxation and political representation, which led to the American Revolution and the ensuing Revolutionary War. The United States declared independence on July 4, 1776, becoming the first nation-state founded on Enlightenment principles of unalienable natural rights, consent of the governed, and republicanism. The country began expanding across North America, spanning the continent by 1848. Sectional division over slavery led to the secession of the Confederate States of America, which fought the remaining states of the Union during the American Civil War (1861–1865). With the Union's victory and preservation, slavery was abolished nationally. By 1900, the United States had established itself as a great power, becoming the world's largest economy. After Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the U.S. entered World War II on the side of the Allies. The aftermath of the war left the United States and the Soviet Union as the world's two superpowers and led to the Cold War, during which both countries engaged in a struggle for ideological dominance and international influence but avoided direct military conflict. During the Space Race, the United States landed the first humans on the Moon. Following the Soviet Union's collapse and the end of the Cold War, the United States emerged as the world's sole superpower.\n",

It has a bicameral national legislature composed of the House of Representatives, a lower house based on population; and the Senate, an upper house based on equal representation for each state. Many policy issues are decentralized at a state or local level, with widely differing laws by jurisdiction. American culture is primarily Anglophonic and generally values the principles of limited government, individualism, and personal autonomy.\n",

The U.S. ranks very highly in international measures of income and wealth, economic competitiveness, innovation, labor productivity, quality of life, human rights, and higher education. The United States is a founding member of the United Nations, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Organization of American States, NATO and WHO, and is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.

       "The first documentary evidence of the phrase \"United States of America\" dates back to a letter from January 2, 1776, written by Stephen Moylan, a Continental Army aide to General George Washington, to Joseph Reed, Washington's aide-de-camp. Moylan expressed his desire to go \"with full and ample powers from the United States of America to Spain\" to seek assistance in the Revolutionary War effort.[26][27][28] The first known publication of the phrase \"United States of America\" was in an anonymous essay in The Virginia Gazette newspaper in Williamsburg, on April 6, 1776.[29]\n",

       "\n",
       "While European settlers experienced conflicts with Native Americans, they also engaged in trade, exchanging European tools for food and animal pelts.[52] The Columbian exchange was catastrophic for native populations. It is estimated that up to 95 percent of the indigenous populations in the Americas perished from infectious diseases during the years following European colonization;[53] remaining populations were often displaced by European expansion.[54][55] Colonial authorities pursued policies to force Native Americans to adopt European lifestyles,[56][57] and European settlers trafficked African slaves into the colonial United States through the Atlantic slave trade.[58]\n",

       "After winning the French and Indian War, Britain began to assert greater control over local colonial affairs, creating colonial political resistance; one of the primary colonial grievances was that Britain taxed the colonies without giving them representation in government. In 1774, the First Continental Congress met in Philadelphia, and passed a colonial boycott of British goods. The British attempt to disarm the colonists resulted in the 1775 Battles of Lexington and Concord, igniting the American Revolutionary War. At the Second Continental Congress, the colonies appointed George Washington commander-in-chief of the Continental Army and created a committee led by Thomas Jefferson to write the Declaration of Independence, adopted on July 4, 1776.[66] The political values of the American Revolution included liberty, inalienable individual rights; and the sovereignty of the people;[67] supporting republicanism and rejecting monarchy, aristocracy, and hereditary political power; virtue and faithfulness in the performance of civic duties; and vilification of corruption.[68] The Founding Fathers of the United States, which included George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, John Jay, James Madison, Thomas Paine, and John Adams, took inspiration from Ancient Greco-Roman, Renaissance, and English models and ideas.[69][70]\n",
       "\n",
       "After British surrender at the siege of Yorktown in 1781, Britain signed a peace treaty. American sovereignty became internationally recognized, and the U.S. gained territory stretching west to the Mississippi River, north to present-day Canada, and south to Spanish Florida.[71] Ratified in 1781, the Articles of Confederation established a decentralized government that operated until 1789.[66] The Northwest Ordinance (1787) established the precedent by which the nation would expand with the admission of new states, rather than the expansion of existing states.[72] The U.S. Constitution was drafted at the 1787 Constitutional Convention; it went into effect in 1789, creating a federation administered by three branches on the principle of checks and balances. Washington was elected the nation's first president under the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights was adopted in 1791 to allay concerns by skeptics of the more centralized government; his resignations as commander-in-chief and President established the precedent of a peaceful transfer of power.[73][74]\n",

       "During the colonial period, slavery was legal in the American colonies, though the practice began to be significantly questioned during the American Revolution.[87] The North enacted abolition laws,[88] though support for slavery strengthened in the South, as inventions such as the cotton gin made the institution increasingly profitable for Southern elites.[89][90][91] This sectional conflict regarding slavery culminated in the American Civil War (1861–1865).[92][93] Eleven slave states seceded and formed the Confederate States of America, while the remaining states remained in the Union.[94] War broke out in April 1861 after the Confederacy bombarded Fort Sumter.[95] After the January 1863 Emancipation Proclamation, many freed slaves joined the Union Army.[96] The war began to turn in the Union's favor following the 1863 Siege of Vicksburg and Battle of Gettysburg, and the Confederacy surrendered in 1865 after the Union's victory in the Battle of Appomattox Court House.[97] The Reconstruction era followed the war. After the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, Reconstruction Amendments were passed to protect the rights of African Americans. National infrastructure, including transcontinental telegraph and railroads, spurred growth in the American frontier.[98]\n",

At the same time, about one million French Canadians migrated from Quebec to New England.[102] During the Great Migration, millions of African Americans left the rural South for urban areas in the North.[103] The Compromise of 1877 effectively ended Reconstruction and white supremacists took local control of Southern politics.[104][105] African Americans endured a period of heightened, overt racism following Reconstruction, a time often called the nadir of American race relations.[106][107] Rapid economic development during the late 19th and early 20th centuries fostered the rise of many prominent industrialists, largely by their formation of trusts and monopolies to prevent competition.[108] Tycoons led the nation's expansion in the railroad, petroleum, and steel industries. Banking became a major part of the economy, and the United States emerged as a pioneer of the automotive industry.[109] These changes were accompanied by significant increases in economic inequality, slum conditions, and social unrest.[110][111][112] This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which was characterized by significant reforms.[113]\n",

Roosevelt responded to with New Deal social and economic policies.[122][123] At first neutral during World War II, the U.S. began supplying war materiel to the Allies of World War II in March 1941 and entered the war in December after the Empire of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor.[124][125] The U.S. developed the first nuclear weapons and used them again the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, ending the war.[126][127] The United States was one of the \"Four Policemen\" who met to plan the postwar world, alongside the United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and China.[128][129] The U.S. emerged relatively unscathed from the war, with even greater economic and military influence.[130]\n",

Major photographers include Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, Dorothea Lange, Edward Weston, James Van Der Zee, Ansel Adams, and Gordon Parks.[473] The Metropolitan Museum of Art U.S. the largest art museum in the United States.[471] The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought global fame to American architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry.[474]\n",

Hollywood, a district in northern Los Angeles, the nation's second-most populous city, is the leader in motion picture production and the most recognizable movie industry in the world.[475][476][477] The major film studios of the United States are the primary source of the most commercially successful and most ticket-selling movies in the world.[478][479] Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood, although in the 21st century an increasing number of films are not made there, and film companies have been subject to the forces of globalization.[480] The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, have been held annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1929,[481] and the Golden Globe Awards have been held annually since January 1944.[482]\n",

       "The industry enjoyed its golden years, in what is commonly referred to as the \"Golden Age of Hollywood\", from the early sound period until the early 1960s,[483] with screen actors such as John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe becoming iconic figures.[484][485] In the 1970s, \"New Hollywood\" or the \"Hollywood Renaissance\"[486] was defined by grittier films influenced by French and Italian realist pictures of the post-war period.[487] The 21st century was marked by the rise of American streaming platforms, which came to rival traditional cinema.[488][489]\n",

       "Early settlers were introduced by Native Americans to such indigenous, non-European foods as turkey, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup. Of the most enduring and pervasive examples are variations of the native dish called succotash. Early settlers and later immigrants combined these with foods they had known, such as wheat flour,[490] beef, and milk to create a distinctive American cuisine.[491][492] New World crops, especially corn and potatoes, and the native turkey as the main course are part of a shared national menu on one of America's most popular holidays, Thanksgiving, when many Americans make or purchase traditional dishes to celebrate the occasion.[493]\n",

       "Characteristic American dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken, doughnuts, french fries, macaroni and cheese, ice cream, pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrant groups.[494][495][496][497] Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos preexisted the United States in areas later annexed from Mexico, and pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are all widely consumed.[498]\n",

Basketball, soccer and ice hockey are the country's next three most popular professional team sports, with the top leagues being the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League, which are the premier leagues worldwide for these sports.

This method suits huge text (books) with a logical break in context (chapters). But it also has some challenges. Each run through the LLM gives opportunities for the LLM to be creative (and hallucinate) and make the final output harder to work with. Also, each run through the LLM is cost $$$ and is slow.  \n",
    "3. Using statistical methods like Latent Semantic Analytics (LSA) to remove excess (redundant) information from the text. I like the LSA method with a combination of LLM because it combines the best of worlds. LSA is good at distilling text into essential information, but the output is hard to read. LLM can take the LSA output, make sense of it, and write an excellent summary or other task. This notebook focuses on this method.\n",
