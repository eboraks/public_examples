The U.S. is the world\\'s third-largest country by both land and total area.[c] It shares land borders with Canada to its north and with Mexico to its south and has maritime borders with the Bahamas, Cuba, Russia, and other nations.[j] With a population of over 333 million,[k] it is the most populous country in the Americas and the third-most populous in the world. The national capital of the United States is Washington, D.C., and its most populous city and principal financial center is New York City.\\n\\nIndigenous peoples have inhabited the Americas for thousands of years. Beginning in 1607, British colonization led to the establishment of the Thirteen Colonies in what is now the Eastern United States. They clashed with the British Crown over taxation and political representation, which led to the American Revolution and the ensuing Revolutionary War. The United States declared independence on July 4, 1776, becoming the first nation-state founded on Enlightenment principles of unalienable natural rights, consent of the governed, and republicanism. The country began expanding across North America, spanning the continent by 1848. Sectional division over slavery led to the secession of the Confederate States of America, which fought the remaining states of the Union during the American Civil War (1861–1865). With the Union\\'s victory and preservation, slavery was abolished nationally. By 1900, the United States had established itself as a great power, becoming the world\\'s largest economy. After Japan\\'s attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the U.S. entered World War II on the side of the Allies. The aftermath of the war left the United States and the Soviet Union as the world\\'s two superpowers and led to the Cold War, during which both countries engaged in a struggle for ideological dominance and international influence but avoided direct military conflict. During the Space Race, the United States landed the first humans on the Moon. Following the Soviet Union\\'s collapse and the end of the Cold War, the United States emerged as the world\\'s sole superpower.\\n\\nThe United States government is a federal presidential constitutional republic and liberal democracy with three separate branches of government: executive, legislative, and judicial. It has a bicameral national legislature composed of the House of Representatives, a lower house based on population; and the Senate, an upper house based on equal representation for each state. Many policy issues are decentralized at a state or local level, with widely differing laws by jurisdiction. American culture is primarily Anglophonic and generally values the principles of limited government, individualism, and personal autonomy.\\n\\nAs a highly developed country, the U.S. possesses the largest amount of wealth of any country. The American economy accounts for over a quarter of the global GDP and is nominally the world\\'s largest. It is the largest importer and the second-largest exporter of the world. The U.S. ranks very highly in international measures of income and wealth, economic competitiveness, innovation, labor productivity, quality of life, human rights, and higher education. The United States is a founding member of the United Nations, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the Organization of American States, NATO and WHO, and is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. It is a recognized nuclear-weapon state and wields considerable global influence as the world\\'s foremost political, cultural, economic, military, and scientific power.\\n\\nEtymology\\nFurther information: Names of the United States and Demonyms for the United States\\nThe first documentary evidence of the phrase \"United States of America\" dates back to a letter from January 2, 1776, written by Stephen Moylan, a Continental Army aide to General George Washington, to Joseph Reed, Washington\\'s aide-de-camp. Moylan expressed his desire to go \"with full and ample powers from the United States of America to Spain\" to seek assistance in the Revolutionary War effort.[26][27][28] The first known publication of the phrase \"United States of America\" was in an anonymous essay in The Virginia Gazette newspaper in Williamsburg, on April 6, 1776.[29]\\n\\nBy June 1776, the name \"United States of America\" appeared in drafts of the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, authored by John Dickinson, a Founding Father from the Province of Pennsylvania,[30][31] and in the Declaration of Independence, written primarily by Thomas Jefferson and adopted by the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, on July 4, 1776.[30][32]\\n\\nHistory\\nMain article: History of the United States\\nFor a topical guide, see Outline of United States history.\\nIndigenous peoples\\nFurther information: Native Americans in the United States and Pre-Columbian era\\n\\nThe Cliff Palace was built by Ancestral Puebloans.\\nThe first inhabitants of North America migrated from Siberia across the Bering land bridge at least 12,000 years ago;[33][34] the Clovis culture, which appeared around 11,000 BC, is believed to be the first widespread culture in the Americas.[35][36] Over time, indigenous North American culutures grew increasingly sophisticated, and some, such as the Mississippian culture, developed agriculture, architecture, and complex societies.[37] Indigenous peoples and cultures such as the Algonquian peoples,[38] Ancestral Puebloans,[39] and the Iroquois developed across the present-day United States.[40] Native population estimates of what is now the United States before the arrival of European immigrants range from around 500,000[41][42] to nearly 10 million.[42][43]\\n\\nEuropean colonization\\nMain article: Colonial history of the United States\\n\\nBritish North America in 1775 with the 13 colonies\\nChristopher Columbus began exploring the Caribbean in 1492, leading to Spanish settlements in present-day Puerto Rico, Florida, and New Mexico.[44][45][46] France established their own settlements along the Mississippi River and Gulf of Mexico.[47] British colonization of the East Coast began with the Virginia Colony (1607) and Plymouth Colony (1620).[48][49] The Mayflower Compact and the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut established precedents for representative self-governance and constitutionalism that would develop throughout the American colonies.[50][51]\\n\\nWhile European settlers experienced conflicts with Native Americans, they also engaged in trade, exchanging European tools for food and animal pelts.[52] The Columbian exchange was catastrophic for native populations. It is estimated that up to 95 percent of the indigenous populations in the Americas perished from infectious diseases during the years following European colonization;[53] remaining populations were often displaced by European expansion.[54][55] Colonial authorities pursued policies to force Native Americans to adopt European lifestyles,[56][57] and European settlers trafficked African slaves into the colonial United States through the Atlantic slave trade.[58]\\n\\nThe original Thirteen Colonies[l] were administered by Great Britain,[59] and had local governments with elections open to most white male property owners.[60][61] The colonial population grew rapidly, eclipsing Native American populations;[62] by the 1770s, the natural increase of the population was such that only a small minority of Americans had been born overseas.[63] The colonies\\' distance from Britain allowed for the development of self-governance,[64] and the First Great Awakening—a series of Christian revivals—fueled colonial interest in religious liberty.[65]\\n\\nRevolution and expansion (1776-1861)\\nFurther information: History of the United States (1776–1789), History of the United States (1789–1849), and History of the United States (1849–1865)\\nSee caption\\nDeclaration of Independence, a portrait by John Trumbull depicting the Committee of Five presenting the draft of the Declaration to the Continental Congress on June 28, 1776, in Philadelphia\\nAfter winning the French and Indian War, Britain began to assert greater control over local colonial affairs, creating colonial political resistance; one of the primary colonial grievances was that Britain taxed the colonies without giving them representation in government. In 1774, the First Continental Congress met in Philadelphia, and passed a colonial boycott of British goods. The British attempt to disarm the colonists resulted in the 1775 Battles of Lexington and Concord, igniting the American Revolutionary War. At the Second Continental Congress, the colonies appointed George Washington commander-in-chief of the Continental Army and created a committee led by Thomas Jefferson to write the Declaration of Independence, adopted on July 4, 1776.[66] The political values of the American Revolution included liberty, inalienable individual rights; and the sovereignty of the people;[67] supporting republicanism and rejecting monarchy, aristocracy, and hereditary political power; virtue and faithfulness in the performance of civic duties; and vilification of corruption.[68] The Founding Fathers of the United States, which included George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, John Jay, James Madison, Thomas Paine, and John Adams, took inspiration from Ancient Greco-Roman, Renaissance, and English models and ideas.[69][70]\\n\\nAfter British surrender at the siege of Yorktown in 1781, Britain signed a peace treaty. American sovereignty became internationally recognized, and the U.S. gained territory stretching west to the Mississippi River, north to present-day Canada, and south to Spanish Florida.[71] Ratified in 1781, the Articles of Confederation established a decentralized government that operated until 1789.[66] The Northwest Ordinance (1787) established the precedent by which the nation would expand with the admission of new states, rather than the expansion of existing states.[72] The U.S. Constitution was drafted at the 1787 Constitutional Convention; it went into effect in 1789, creating a federation administered by three branches on the principle of checks and balances. Washington was elected the nation\\'s first president under the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights was adopted in 1791 to allay concerns by skeptics of the more centralized government; his resignations as commander-in-chief and President established the precedent of a peaceful transfer of power.[73][74]\\n\\nA map of the United States showing its territorial acquisitions over time\\nA map of the territorial acquisitions of the United States\\nIn the late 18th century, American settlers began to expand westward, with a sense of manifest destiny.[75] The Louisiana Purchase (1803) from France nearly doubled the territory of the United States.[76] Lingering issues with Britain remained, leading to the War of 1812, which was fought to a draw.[77] Spain ceded Florida and their Gulf Coast territory in 1819.[78] As Americans expanded further into land inhabited by Native Americans, the federal government often applied policies of Indian removal or assimilation.[79][80] The displacement prompted a long series of American Indian Wars west of the Mississippi River.[81][82] The Republic of Texas was annexed in 1845,[83] and the 1846 Oregon Treaty led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest.[84] Victory in the Mexican–American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest, resulting in the U.S. stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific oceans.[75][85] Alaska was purchased from Russia in 1867.[86]\\n\\nCivil War (1861-1865)\\nMain article: American Civil War\\n\\nDivision of the states during the American Civil War\\nDuring the colonial period, slavery was legal in the American colonies, though the practice began to be significantly questioned during the American Revolution.[87] The North enacted abolition laws,[88] though support for slavery strengthened in the South, as inventions such as the cotton gin made the institution increasingly profitable for Southern elites.[89][90][91] This sectional conflict regarding slavery culminated in the American Civil War (1861–1865).[92][93] Eleven slave states seceded and formed the Confederate States of America, while the remaining states remained in the Union.[94] War broke out in April 1861 after the Confederacy bombarded Fort Sumter.[95] After the January 1863 Emancipation Proclamation, many freed slaves joined the Union Army.[96] The war began to turn in the Union\\'s favor following the 1863 Siege of Vicksburg and Battle of Gettysburg, and the Confederacy surrendered in 1865 after the Union\\'s victory in the Battle of Appomattox Court House.[97] The Reconstruction era followed the war. After the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, Reconstruction Amendments were passed to protect the rights of African Americans. National infrastructure, including transcontinental telegraph and railroads, spurred growth in the American frontier.[98]\\n\\nPost-Civil War era (1865-1898)\\nMain article: History of the United States (1865–1918)\\nDuration: 2 minutes and 43 seconds.2:43\\nAn Edison Studios film showing immigrants arriving at Ellis Island in New York Harbor, a major point of entry for European immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries[99][100]\\nFrom 1865 through 1918 an unprecedented stream of immigrants arrived in the United States, including 24.4 million from Europe.[101] Most came through the port of New York City, and New York and other large cities on the East Coast became home to large Jewish, Irish, and Italian populations, while many Germans and Central Europeans moved to the Midwest. At the same time, about one million French Canadians migrated from Quebec to New England.[102] During the Great Migration, millions of African Americans left the rural South for urban areas in the North.[103] The Compromise of 1877 effectively ended Reconstruction and white supremacists took local control of Southern politics.[104][105] African Americans endured a period of heightened, overt racism following Reconstruction, a time often called the nadir of American race relations.[106][107] Rapid economic development during the late 19th and early 20th centuries fostered the rise of many prominent industrialists, largely by their formation of trusts and monopolies to prevent competition.[108] Tycoons led the nation\\'s expansion in the railroad, petroleum, and steel industries. Banking became a major part of the economy, and the United States emerged as a pioneer of the automotive industry.[109] These changes were accompanied by significant increases in economic inequality, slum conditions, and social unrest.[110][111][112] This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which was characterized by significant reforms.[113]\\n\\nRise as a superpower (1898-1945)\\nMain articles: History of the United States (1918–1945) and History of the United States (1918–1945)\\n\\nThe Trinity nuclear test in the Jornada del Muerto desert on July 16, 1945, part of the Manhattan Project and the first detonation of a nuclear weapon\\nThe early 20th century was a time of industrial expansion and social change in the United States.[114][115] Pro-American elements in Hawaii overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy; the islands were annexed in 1898. Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines were ceded by Spain following the Spanish–American War.[116] American Samoa was acquired by the United States in 1900 after the Second Samoan Civil War.[117] The U.S. Virgin Islands were purchased from Denmark in 1917.[118] The United States entered World War I alongside the Allies of World War I, helping to turn the tide against the Central Powers.[119] In 1920, a constitutional amendment granted nationwide women\\'s suffrage.[120] During the 1920s and 1930s, radio for mass communication and the invention of early television transformed communications nationwide.[121] The Wall Street Crash of 1929 triggered the Great Depression, which President Franklin D.

New England and the Western United States tend to be less religious,[351] although Mormonism—a Restorationist Christian movement started in New York in the 19th century—is the predominant religious affiliation in Utah.[352]\\n\\nUrbanization\\nMain articles: Urbanization in the United States and List of United States cities by population\\nAbout 82% of Americans live in urban areas, including suburbs;[149] about half of those reside in cities with populations over 50,000.[353] In 2022, 333 incorporated municipalities had populations over 100,000, nine cities had more than one million residents, and four cities (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston) had populations exceeding two million.[354] Many U.S. metropolitan populations are growing rapidly, particularly in the South and West.[355]\\n vte\\nLargest metropolitan areas in the United States\\n2021 MSA population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau\\nRank\\tName\\tRegion\\tPop.\\tRank\\tName\\tRegion\\tPop.\\t\\nNew York\\nNew York\\nLos Angeles\\nLos Angeles\\t1\\tNew York\\tNortheast\\t19,768,458\\t11\\tBoston\\tNortheast\\t4,899,932\\tChicago\\nChicago\\nDallas–Fort Worth\\nDallas–Fort Worth\\n2\\tLos Angeles\\tWest\\t12,997,353\\t12\\tRiverside–San Bernardino\\tWest\\t4,653,105\\n3\\tChicago\\tMidwest\\t9,509,934\\t13\\tSan Francisco\\tWest\\t4,623,264\\n4\\tDallas–Fort Worth\\tSouth\\t7,759,615\\t14\\tDetroit\\tMidwest\\t4,365,205\\n5\\tHouston\\tSouth\\t7,206,841\\t15\\tSeattle\\tWest\\t4,011,553\\n6\\tWashington, D.C.\\tSouth\\t6,356,434\\t16\\tMinneapolis–Saint Paul\\tMidwest\\t3,690,512\\n7\\tPhiladelphia\\tNortheast\\t6,228,601\\t17\\tSan Diego\\tWest\\t3,286,069\\n8\\tAtlanta\\tSouth\\t6,144,050\\t18\\tTampa–St. Petersburg\\tSouth\\t3,219,514\\n9\\tMiami\\tSouth\\t6,091,747\\t19\\tDenver\\tWest\\t2,972,566\\n10\\tPhoenix\\tWest\\t4,946,145\\t20\\tBaltimore\\tSouth\\t2,838,327\\n\\nHealth\\nSee also: Healthcare in the United States, Healthcare reform in the United States, and Health insurance in the United States\\nThe Texas Medical Center, a cluster of contemporary skyscrapers, at night\\nTexas Medical Center in Houston is the largest medical complex in the world, employing 106,000 people and treating 10 million patients annually as of 2016.[356]\\nIn a preliminary report, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced that U.S. life expectancy at birth was 76.4 years in 2021 (73.2 years for men and 79.1 years for women), down 0.9 years from 2020. The chief causes listed were the COVID-19 pandemic, accidents, drug overdoses, heart and liver disease, and suicides.[357][358] Life expectancy was highest among Asians and Hispanics and lowest among Black and American Indian–Alaskan Native (AIAN) peoples.[359][360] Starting in 1998, the life expectancy in the U.S. fell behind that of other wealthy industrialized countries, and Americans\\' \"health disadvantage\" gap has been increasing ever since.[361] The U.S. has one of the highest suicide rates among high-income countries.[362] Approximately one-third of the U.S. adult population is obese and another third is overweight.[363] The U.S. healthcare system far outspends that of any other nation, measured both in per capita spending and as a percentage of GDP, but attains worse healthcare outcomes when compared to peer nations for reasons that are debate.[364] The United States is the only developed nation without a system of universal healthcare, and a significant proportion of the population that does not carry health insurance.[365] Government-funded healthcare coverage for the poor (Medicaid) and for those age 65 and older (Medicare) is available to Americans who meet the programs\\' income or age qualifications. In 2010, former President Obama passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.[o][366]\\n\\nEducation\\nMain articles: Education in the United States and Higher education in the United States\\nPhotograph of the University of Virginia\\nThe University of Virginia, founded by Thomas Jefferson in 1819, is one of many public colleges and universities in the United States.\\nAmerican public education is operated by state and local governments and regulated by the United States Department of Education through restrictions on federal grants. In most states, children are required to attend school from the age of five or six (beginning with kindergarten or first grade) until they turn 18 (generally bringing them through twelfth grade, the end of high school); some states allow students to leave school at 16 or 17.[367] Of Americans 25 and older, 84.6% graduated from high school, 52.6% attended some college, 27.2% earned a bachelor\\'s degree, and 9.6% earned graduate degrees.[368] The basic literacy rate is near-universal.[149][369] The country has the most Nobel Prize winners in history, with 411 (having won 413 awards).[370][371]\\n\\nThe United States has many private and public institutions of higher education including many of the world\\'s top universities, as listed by various ranking organizations, are in the United States, including 19 of the top 25.[372][373][374] There are local community colleges with generally more open admission policies, shorter academic programs, and lower tuition.[375] The U.S. spends more on education per student than any nation in the world,[376] spending an average of $12,794 per year on public elementary and secondary school students in the 2016–2017 school year.[377]\\n\\nAs for public expenditures on higher education, the U.S. spends more per student than the OECD average, and more than all nations in combined public and private spending.[378] Despite some student loan forgiveness programs in place,[379] student loan debt has increased by 102% in the last decade,[380] and exceeded 1.7 trillion dollars as of 2022.[381]\\n\\nCulture and society\\nMain articles: Culture of the United States and Society of the United States\\nThe Statue of Liberty, a large teal bronze sculpture on a stone pedestal\\nThe Statue of Liberty (Liberty Enlightening the World) on Liberty Island in New York Harbor was an 1866 gift from France that has become an iconic symbol of the American Dream.[382]\\nAmericans have traditionally been characterized by a unifying political belief in an \"American creed\" emphasizing liberty, equality under the law, democracy, social equality, property rights, and a preference for limited government.[383][384] Culturally, the country has been described as having the values of individualism and personal autonomy,[385][386] having a strong work ethic,[387] competitiveness,[388] and voluntary altruism towards others.[389][390][391] According to a 2016 study by the Charities Aid Foundation, Americans donated 1.44% of total GDP to charity, the highest rate in the world by a large margin.[392] Part of both the Anglosphere and Western World, the United States is also home to a wide variety of ethnic groups, traditions, and values,[393][394] and exerts immense cultural influence globally,[395][396] with the phenomenon being termed Americanization.[397] As such, the U.S. is considered a cultural superpower.[398]\\n\\nNearly all present Americans or their ancestors came from Eurafrasia (\"the Old World\") within the past five centuries.[399] Mainstream American culture is a Western culture largely derived from the traditions of European immigrants with influences from many other sources, such as traditions brought by slaves from Africa.[393][400] More recent immigration from Asia and especially Latin America has added to a cultural mix that has been described as a homogenizing melting pot, and a heterogeneous salad bowl, with immigrants contributing to, and often assimilating into, mainstream American culture.[393] The American Dream, or the perception that Americans enjoy high social mobility, plays a key role in attracting immigrants.[401] Whether this perception is accurate has been a topic of debate.[402][403][404][405] While mainstream culture holds that the United States is a classless society,[406] scholars identify significant differences between the country\\'s social classes, affecting socialization, language, and values.[407] Americans tend to greatly value socioeconomic achievement, but being ordinary or average is promoted by some as a noble condition as well.[408]\\n\\nThe United States is considered to have the strongest protections of free speech of any country under the First Amendment,[409] which protects flag desecration, hate speech, blasphemy, and lese-majesty as forms of protected expression.[410][411][412] A 2016 Pew Research Center poll found that Americans were the most supportive of free expression of any polity measured.[413] They are the \"most supportive of freedom of the press and the right to use the Internet without government censorship.\"[414] It is a socially progressive country[415] with permissive attitudes surrounding human sexuality.[416] LGBT rights in the United States are among the most advanced in the world.[416][417][418]\\n\\nLiterature\\nMain articles: American literature and American philosophy\\nPhotograph of Mark Twain\\nMark Twain, who William Faulkner called \"the father of American literature\"[419]\\nColonial American authors were influenced by John Locke and other Enlightenment philosophers.[420][421] Before and shortly after the Revolutionary War, the newspaper rose to prominence, filling a demand for anti-British national literature.[422][423] During the nineteenth-century American Renaissance, writers like Walt Whitman and Harriet Beecher Stowe established a distinctive American literary tradition.[424][425] As literacy rates rose, periodicals published more stories centered around industrial workers, women, and the rural poor.[426][427] Naturalism, regionalism, and realism—the latter associated with Mark Twain—were the major literary movements of the period.[428][429]\\n\\nWhile modernism generally took on an international character, modernist authors working within the United States more often rooted their work in specific regions, peoples, and cultures.[430] Following the Great Migration to northern cities, African-American and black West Indian authors of the Harlem Renaissance developed an independent tradition of literature that rebuked a history of inequality and celebrated black culture. An important cultural export during the Jazz Age, these writings were a key influence on the négritude philosophy.[431][432] In the 1950s, an ideal of homogeneity led many authors to attempt to write the Great American Novel,[433] while the Beat Generation rejected this conformity, using styles that elevated the impact of the spoken word over mechanics to describe drug use, sexuality, and the failings of society.[434][435] Contemporary literature is more pluralistic than in previous eras, with the closest thing to a unifying feature being a trend toward self-conscious experiments with language.[436]\\n\\nMass media\\nFurther information: Mass media in the United States\\nSee also: Newspapers in the United States, Television in the United States, Internet in the United States, Radio in the United States, and Video games in the United States\\n\\nComcast Center in Philadelphia, headquarters of Comcast, the world\\'s largest telecommunications and media conglomerate\\nMedia is broadly uncensored, with the First Amendment providing significant protections, as reiterated in New York Times Co. v. United States.[409] The four major broadcasters in the U.S. are the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), American Broadcasting Company (ABC), and Fox Broadcasting Company (FOX). The four major broadcast television networks are all commercial entities. Cable television offers hundreds of channels catering to a variety of niches.[437] As of 2021, about 83% of Americans over age 12 listen to broadcast radio, while about 41% listen to podcasts.[438] As of September 30, 2014, there are 15,433 licensed full-power radio stations in the U.S. according to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC).[439] Much of the public radio broadcasting is supplied by NPR, incorporated in February 1970 under the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967.[440]\\n\\nGlobally-recognized newspapers in the United States include The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The Washington Post, and USA Today.[441] More than 800 publications are produced in Spanish, the second most commonly used language in the United States behind English.[442][443] With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned, either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy, which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or, in a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families. Major cities often have alternative newspapers to complement the mainstream daily papers, such as The Village Voice in New York City and LA Weekly in Los Angeles. The five most popular websites used in the U.S. are Google, YouTube, Amazon, Yahoo, and Facebook, with all of them being American companies.[444]\\n\\nAs of 2022, the video game market of the United States is the world\\'s largest by revenue.[445] Major video game publishers and developers headquartered in the United States are Sony Interactive Entertainment, Take-Two, Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts, Xbox Game Studios, Bethesda Softworks, Epic Games, Valve, Warner Bros., Riot Games, and others.[446][447] There are 444 publishers, developers, and hardware companies in California alone.[448]\\n\\nTheater\\nMain article: Theater in the United States\\n\\nBroadway theatres in Theater District, Manhattan, New York City\\nThe United States is well known for its cinema and theater. Mainstream theater in the United States derives from the old European theatrical tradition and has been heavily influenced by the British theater.[449] The central hub of the American theater scene is Manhattan, with its divisions of Broadway, off-Broadway, and off-off-Broadway.[450] Many movie and television stars have gotten their big break working in New York productions. Outside New York City, many cities have professional regional or resident theater companies that produce their own seasons. The biggest-budget theatrical productions are musicals. U.S. theater has an active community theater culture.[451]\\n\\nThe Tony Awards recognizes excellence in live Broadway theatre and are presented at an annual ceremony in Manhattan. The awards are given for Broadway productions and performances. One is also given for regional theatre. Several discretionary non-competitive awards are given as well, including a Special Tony Award, the Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre, and the Isabelle Stevenson Award.[452]\\n\\nFashion\\nFurther information: Fashion in the United States and New York Fashion Week\\n\\nHaute couture fashion models walk the runway during New York Fashion Week.\\nFashion has become one of the most prominent American culture genres. New York has frequently been ranked the top fashion capital of the world on the annual list compiled by the Global Language Monitor.[453] The United States sets the tone for the global fashion industry.[454] New York Fashion Week (NYFW) is a high-profile semiannual event featuring models displaying the latest wardrobes created by prominent fashion designers worldwide in advance of these fashions proceeding to the retail marketplace.[455]\\n\\nMusic\\nMain article: Music of the United States\\nThe United States has the world\\'s largest music market with a total retail value of $15.9 billion in 2022.[456] Most of the world\\'s major record companies are based in the U.S.; they are represented by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[457]\\n\\nAmerican folk music encompasses numerous music genres, variously known as traditional music, traditional folk music, contemporary folk music, or roots music. Many traditional songs have been sung within the same family or folk group for generations, and sometimes trace back to such origins as the British Isles, Mainland Europe, or Africa.[458] Elements from folk idioms such as the blues and what is known as old-time music were adopted and transformed into popular genres with global audiences.\\n\\n\\nThe Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, Tennessee\\nJazz grew from blues and ragtime in the early 20th century due to the innovations and recordings of composers such as W.C. Handy and Jelly Roll Morton. Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington increased its popularity early in the 20th century.[459] The rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music have also influenced American music at large.[460] Country music developed in the 1920s, and rhythm and blues in the 1940s.\\n\\nFirst invented in the 1930s, and mass-produced by the 1940s, the electric guitar had an enormous influence on popular music, in particular due to the development of rock and roll,[461] pioneered by Elvis Presley and Chuck Berry, among others, in the mid-1950s. Rock bands such as Metallica, the Eagles, and Aerosmith are among the highest grossing musical acts in worldwide sales.[462][463][464] In the 1960s, Bob Dylan emerged from the folk revival to become one of the country\\'s most celebrated songwriters.[465] Mid-20th-century American pop stars such as Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra,[466] and Elvis Presley became global celebrities,[459] as have artists of the late 20th century, such as Prince,[467] Michael Jackson, Madonna, Whitney Houston,[468] and Mariah Carey, and of the early 21st century, such as Taylor Swift, Eminem, Ariana Grande, Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, and Bruno Mars. The musical forms of punk and hip hop both originated in the United States.[469] American professional opera singers have reached the highest level of success in that form, including Renée Fleming, Leontyne Price, Beverly Sills, Nelson Eddy, and many others.[470]\\n\\nVisual arts\\nMain articles: Visual art of the United States and Architecture of the United States\\n\\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan is the largest American art museum.[471]\\nIn the visual arts, the Hudson River School was a mid-19th-century movement in the tradition of European naturalism. The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an exhibition of European modernist art, shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene.[472] Georgia O\\'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, and others experimented with new, individualistic styles, which would become known as American modernism. Major artistic movements such as the abstract expressionism of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and the pop art of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein developed largely in the United States. Major photographers include Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen, Dorothea Lange, Edward Weston, James Van Der Zee, Ansel Adams, and Gordon Parks.[473] The Metropolitan Museum of Art U.S. the largest art museum in the United States.[471] The tide of modernism and then postmodernism has brought global fame to American architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright, Philip Johnson, and Frank Gehry.[474]\\n\\nCinema\\nMain article: Cinema of the United States\\n\\nThe iconic Hollywood Sign, in the Hollywood Hills, often regarded as the symbol of the American film industry\\nThe U.S. film industry has a worldwide influence and following. Hollywood, a district in northern Los Angeles, the nation\\'s second-most populous city, is the leader in motion picture production and the most recognizable movie industry in the world.[475][476][477] The major film studios of the United States are the primary source of the most commercially successful and most ticket-selling movies in the world.[478][479] Since the early 20th century, the U.S. film industry has largely been based in and around Hollywood, although in the 21st century an increasing number of films are not made there, and film companies have been subject to the forces of globalization.[480] The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, have been held annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences since 1929,[481] and the Golden Globe Awards have been held annually since January 1944.[482]\\n\\nThe industry enjoyed its golden years, in what is commonly referred to as the \"Golden Age of Hollywood\", from the early sound period until the early 1960s,[483] with screen actors such as John Wayne and Marilyn Monroe becoming iconic figures.[484][485] In the 1970s, \"New Hollywood\" or the \"Hollywood Renaissance\"[486] was defined by grittier films influenced by French and Italian realist pictures of the post-war period.[487] The 21st century was marked by the rise of American streaming platforms, which came to rival traditional cinema.[488][489]\\n\\nCuisine\\nMain article: American cuisine\\nFurther information: List of American regional and fusion cuisines\\n\\nA bacon cheeseburger served with french fries, fried onions, and ketchup\\nEarly settlers were introduced by Native Americans to such indigenous, non-European foods as turkey, sweet potatoes, corn, squash, and maple syrup. Of the most enduring and pervasive examples are variations of the native dish called succotash. Early settlers and later immigrants combined these with foods they had known, such as wheat flour,[490] beef, and milk to create a distinctive American cuisine.[491][492] New World crops, especially corn and potatoes, and the native turkey as the main course are part of a shared national menu on one of America\\'s most popular holidays, Thanksgiving, when many Americans make or purchase traditional dishes to celebrate the occasion.[493]\\n\\nCharacteristic American dishes such as apple pie, fried chicken, doughnuts, french fries, macaroni and cheese, ice cream, pizza, hamburgers, and hot dogs derive from the recipes of various immigrant groups.[494][495][496][497] Mexican dishes such as burritos and tacos preexisted the United States in areas later annexed from Mexico, and pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources are all widely consumed.[498]\\n\\nThe American fast food industry, the world\\'s first and largest, pioneered the drive-through format in the 1940s[499] and is often viewed as being a symbol of U.S. marketing dominance. American companies such as McDonald\\'s,[500] Burger King, Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Domino\\'s Pizza, among many others, have numerous outlets around the world.[501]\\n\\nSports\\nMain article: Sports in the United States\\nSee also: Professional sports leagues in the United States, National Collegiate Athletic Association, and United States at the Olympics\\n\\nAmerican football is the most popular sport in the United States; in this September 2022 National Football League game, the Jacksonville Jaguars play the Washington Commanders at FedExField.\\nThe most popular spectator sports in the U.S. are American football, basketball, baseball, soccer, and ice hockey.[502] While most major U.S. sports such as baseball and American football have evolved out of European practices, basketball, volleyball, skateboarding, and snowboarding are American inventions, many of which have become popular worldwide.[503] Lacrosse and surfing arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate European contact.[504] The market for professional sports in the United States was approximately $69 billion in July 2013, roughly 50% larger than that of all of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined.[505]\\n\\nAmerican football is by several measures the most popular spectator sport in the United States;[506] the National Football League (NFL) has the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world, and the Super Bowl is watched by tens of millions globally.[507] Baseball has been regarded as the U.S. national sport since the late 19th century, with Major League Baseball being the top league. Basketball, soccer and ice hockey are the country\\'s next three most popular professional team sports, with the top leagues being the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League, which are the premier leagues worldwide for these sports. The most-watched individual sports in the U.S. are golf and auto racing, particularly NASCAR and IndyCar.[508][509]\\n\\nOn the collegiate level, earnings for the member institutions exceed $1 billion annually,[510] and college football and basketball attract large audiences, as the NCAA Final Four is one of the most watched national sporting events.[511] In many respects, the intercollegiate sports level serves as a feeder system to the professional level, as the elite college athletes are chosen to compete at the next level. This system differs greatly from nearly all other countries in the world, which generally have government-funded sports organizations that serve as a feeder system for professional competition.[512]\\n\\nEight Olympic Games have taken place in the United States. The 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, were the first-ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe.[513] The Olympic Games will be held in the U.S. for a ninth time when Los Angeles hosts the 2028 Summer Olympics. U.S. athletes have won a total of 2,959 medals (1,173 gold) at the Olympic Games, by far the most of any country.[514][515][516]\\n\\nIn international soccer, the men\\'s national soccer team qualified for eleven World Cups, and the women\\'s national team has won the FIFA Women\\'s World Cup and Olympic soccer tournament four times each.[517] The United States hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup and will co-host, along with Canada and Mexico, the 2026 FIFA World Cup.[518]\\n\\n\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States'"

Soft launch is important to consider because it allows developers to get valuable feedback from players that can help improve the game before it is released to everyone. Soft launch can be applied to PC and console games as well as mobile platforms. The investment required for a soft launch is dependent on the goals for soft launch.
